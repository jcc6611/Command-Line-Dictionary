# Description
A simple command line dictionary utility made in Python.
Search for words and get their definitions

# What I Learned
I learned how to use difflib to check for text-similarity so I could make suggestions 
for incorrect user input (ex: typing "rainn" instead of "rain" will not throw an error, 
but instead suggest "rain" as a search option),
and how to read data from a json file.

# How It Can be Improved
I can make a GUI or WebApp for this program. Also, I can get data from a database rather than a json file 
since that would be more efficient.
